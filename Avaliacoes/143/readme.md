### 143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

    L0 → L1 → … → L(n - 1) → L(n)

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

    L0 → L(n) → L1 → L(n - 1) → L2 → L(n - 2) → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,4,2,3]

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
    1 <= Node.val <= 1000
